to convert to .doc for clemens:
 	mk4ht mzlatex ./exp_paper.tex "html, mathtools"
produces an xml and a css file. Take the xml file and delete the first line, this is the declaration that it is a xml not html
change the xml extension to .doc and copy (along with the .css file) to a computer with word
open in word, may have to open word then then open the file. if there is some dtd error then the xml declaration may still be there
save as a word 2010 or whatever file.
