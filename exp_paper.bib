A laser-made dot grid on the crosscut area of the uncompressed specimen was used to calculate plastic strains by image analysis of the displacement of dots after compression. Multivariate models were developed to determine the causes of deformation. The lower face was restrained by the press table and remained flat whereas sides attached to the rubber diaphragm became more irregularly shaped when compressed. Most of the total compression occurred below 50 {MPa} and was determined exclusively by pressure. Above 50 {MPa}, wood density was more important and compression was lower in the interior of specimens and in heartwood. Plastic compressive strain occurred predominately in the radial direction and toward the rigid press table. Strains were dependent on the sawing pattern and orientation. The growth rings of quarter-sawn specimens oriented with the outer face (bark side) down tended to buckle.},

	abstract = {Growth of turgid cells, defined as an irreversible increase in cell volume and surface area, can be regarded as a physical process governed by the mechanical properties of the cell wall and the osmotic properties of the protoplast. Irreversible cell expansion is produced by creating a driving force for water uptake by decreasing the turgor through stress relaxation in the cell wall. This mechano-hydraulic process thus depends on and can be controlled by the mechanical properties of the wall, which in turn are subject to modification by wall loosening and wall stiffening reactions. The biochemical mechanisms of these changes in mechanical wall properties and their regulation by internal signals (e.g., hormones) or external signals (e.g., light, drought stress) are at present incompletely understood and subject to intensive research. These signals act on walls that have the properties of composite materials in which the molecular structure and spatial organization of polymers rather than the distribution of mechanical stresses dictate the allometry of cell and organ growth and thus cell and organ shape. The significance of cell wall architecture for allometric growth can be demonstrated by disturbing the oriented deposition of wall polymers with microtubuleinterfering drugs such as colchicine. Elongating organs (e.g., cylindrical stems or coleoptiles) composed of different tissues with different mechanical properties exhibit longitudinal tissue tensions resulting in the transfer of wall stress from inner to peripheral cell layers that adopt control over organ growth. For physically analyzing the growth process leading to seed germination, the same mechanical and hydraulic parameters as in normal growth are principally appropriate. However, for covering the influences of the tissues that restrain embryo expansion (seed coat, endosperm), an additional force and a water permeability term must be considered.},

Their correlations to density, annual ring width, height in the tree, distribution over the stem diameter and the percentage of compression wood were statistically analysed. All three elasticity modules and the maximal stress can be very well predicted from a linear function of the sample density with a common gradient across the compression wood values but with different intercepts that decrease with increasing compression wood content. The other variables have highly significant impacts on the response variables too, however, this is largely irrelevant for the goodness of fit. Further, a clear increase of density, of {MOE} and of bending {MOR} was measured from pith to bark and similarly with decreasing annual ring width.

For {MOE}, the path coefficients (β) were moderate for density and velocity. For {MOR}, β was only high for density. End-matched samples of one specimen per tree were analyzed with {SilviScan.} Simple correlations with {MOE} were highest for density (r = 0.67) and then acoustic velocity2 (0.53), {MFA} (–0.50), earlywood {MFA} (–0.45), and latewood proportion (0.40..., L’importance relative de la densité, de la vitesse sonique et de l’angle des microfibrilles ({AMF)} pour prédire la rigidité ({MOE)} et la résistance mécanique ({MOR)} n’a pas été clairement établie pour le Douglas vert (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.)

The difference between the two velocities tended to be greater in the older and large diameter trees. The large variability in acoustic velocity, or preferably V2, makes it an efficient wood quality variable for screening trees. Wood density variables did not exhibit any relationship with acoustic velocity or modulus of elasticity ({MoE)} within each age-class. The classic pseudo-relationship observed with pooled data from all stand ages is mainly due to a stand age-effect and so one should be cautious in relying on any significant association between density and {MoE.}},

In-depth discussions cover all of the major aspects of advanced analysis, including three-dimensional effects, viscoelasticity, edge effects, elastic instability, damage, and delamination. More than 50 complete examples using mainly {ANSYS™}, but also including some use of {MATLAB®}, demonstrate how to use the concepts to formulate and execute finite element analyses and how to interpret the results in engineering terms.

He examines the ways in which these laws constrain the organic expression of form, size, and growth in a variety of plant structures, and in plants as whole organisms, and he draws on the fossil record as well as on studies of extant species to present a genuinely evolutionary view of the response of plants to abiotic as well as biotic constraints. Well aware that some readers will need an introduction to basic biomechanics or to basic botany, Niklas provides both, as well as an extensive glossary, and he has included a number of original drawings and photographs to illustrate major structures and {concepts.This} volume emphasizes not only methods of biomechanical analysis but also the ways in which it allows one to ask, and answer, a host of interesting questions. As Niklas points out in the first chapter, From the archaic algae to the most derived multicellular terrestrial plants, from the spectral properties of light-harvesting pigments in chloroplasts to the stacking of leaves in the canopies of trees, the behavior of plants is in large part responsive to and intimately connected with the physical environment. In addition, plants tend to be exquisitely preserved in the fossil record, thereby giving us access to the past. Its biomechanical analyses of various types of plant cells, organs, and whole organisms, and its use of the earliest fossil records of plant life as well as sophisticated current studies of extant species, make this volume a unique and highly integrative contribution to studies of plant form, evolution, ecology, and systematics.},

The {GALES} model calculates the aerodynamic roughness and zero-plane displacement of a forest stand. The aerodynamic roughness provides a measure of the stress (force/unit area) imposed on the canopy as a function of wind speed and the zero-plane displacement provides a measure of the average height on the tree at which the wind acts. Together they allow a calculation of the bending moment imposed on the tree for any wind speed. Data from almost 2000 trees uprooted during pulling experiments and destructive sampling of green wood then allow the model to make predictions of the wind speed at which the tree will be overturned and at which the tree will break for a number of coniferous species. The model assumes a linear relationship between tree stem weight and the maximum resistive moment that can be provided by the root system and it assumes that the stress in the outer fibres of the stem induced by the wind is constant with height. In the {HWIND} model the turning moment arising from the wind drag on the crown is calculated assuming a logarithmic upwind profile. Together with the contribution from the overhanging weight of the stem and branches caused by bending of the stem this provides the total bending moment. The angle of stem bend is explicitly calculated from the stiffness of the stem. The breaking strength of the stem and the support given by the root-soil plate are calculated from previous experiments on timber strength, and tree resistance to overturning by using root-soil plate mass to derive the resistive moment. This allows calculation of the wind speed required to break and overturn the tree. Model comparisons were performed for individual Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies L.) with varying tree height and stem taper (dbh/height). Tree location was at the forest stand edge on a podzolic soil. Model comparisons gave good agreement for the critical wind speeds at the forest edge required to break and overturn trees with a maximum difference in prediction of 26\%. Slightly better agreement was obtained for Norway spruce (mean difference of 10.8\%) than Scots pine (mean difference of 12.3\%) and the best agreement was for trees with a taper of 100. At higher taper the {GALES} model generally predicted higher critical wind speeds than the {HWIND} model whereas at lower taper the reverse applied.},

	abstract = {Recent observations of the temperature anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background ({CMB)} favor an inflationary paradigm in which the scale factor of the universe inflated by many orders of magnitude at some very early time. Such a scenario would produce the observed large-scale isotropy and homogeneity of the universe, as well as the scale-invariant perturbations responsible for the observed (10 parts per million) anisotropies in the {CMB.} An inflationary epoch is also theorized to produce a background of gravitational waves (or tensor perturbations), the effects of which can be observed in the polarization of the {CMB.} The E-mode (or parity even) polarization of the {CMB}, which is produced by scalar perturbations, has now been measured with high significance. Con- trastingly, today the B-mode (or parity odd) polarization, which is sourced by tensor perturbations, has yet to be observed. A detection of the B-mode polarization of the {CMB} would provide strong evidence for an inflationary epoch early in the universe's history. In this work, we explore experimental techniques and analysis methods used to probe the B- mode polarization of the {CMB.} These experimental techniques have been used to build the Bicep2 telescope, which was deployed to the South Pole in 2009. After three years of observations, Bicep2 has acquired one of the deepest observations of the degree-scale polarization of the {CMB} to date. Similarly, this work describes analysis methods developed for the Bicep1 three-year data analysis, which includes the full data set acquired by Bicep1. This analysis has produced the tightest constraint on the B-mode polarization of the {CMB} to date, corresponding to a tensor-to-scalar ratio estimate of r = 0.04±0.32, or a Bayesian 95\% credible interval of r {\textless} 0.70. These analysis methods, in addition to producing this new constraint, are directly applicable to future analyses of Bicep2 data. Taken together, the experimental techniques and analysis methods described herein promise to open a new observational window into the inflationary epoch and the initial conditions of our universe.},

	title = {Hierarchical modelling of softwood hygro-elastic properties},
	abstract = {The hygro-elastic behaviour of wood under load or when subjected to environmental changes is of considerable practical interest. This behaviour can be determined by exhaustive experimentation, but such an approach makes explaining its origin, which from some perspectives can be more important than its prediction, problematic. This thesis attempts to establish a model (actually a hierarchical set of models) that goes some way toward both predicting and explaining the mechanics of wood. Attention is focused on radiata pine because of the commercial importance of this species in New Zealand, but much of the modelling is applicable to other softwoods and, to a lesser extent, hardwoods. Wood can be looked on as a hierarchical material, that is as a material possessing structure at multiple scales. For many problems involving such materials the heteroge- neous structure at a particular scale can be replaced by a homogeneous one possessing similar properties. Homogenization theory defines what is meant by similar and also provides the means for determining these effective properties. In this thesis wood structure is treated at three different scales: namely the supramolecular or nanostructural, the cell-wall or ultrastructural and the cellular or microstructural scales. Homogenization across these levels is performed either analyt- ically or numerically, using the finite element method. At the smallest scale, the constituent phases are treated as homogeneous continua. Models for the hygro-elastic phase properties, as functions of temperature and moisture content are developed based on available experimental data. The models devised to describe wood at each of the above mentioned scales in- troduce a large number of structural parameters, such as constituent mass fractions and cell-wall layer volume fractions. In the abscence of specific data, estimates for these parameters are developed based on data from the literature. Together with these auxiliary models, the main sequence of structural models can then be used to obtain estimates for the material properties of small domains within macrostuctural models.},

Two equations for the estimation of windloads are explained including the problems that their use involves. By use of wind-induced bending moments of trees the occurrence of windbreakage or windthrow is discussed. The response of trees to windloads is mostly in form of damped bending sways. Based on artificial force effects, their shapes are shown to be dependent on soil conditions. If trees are continually exposed to dynamic windloads the shape of their sways is irregular at first sight. During strong winds and storms, the most important load on trees is generally stochastic and can be analysed by the spectral method. Based on this method, results from experimental investigations on wind-induced sways of tall spruce trees within a stand are shown, including power spectra of Reynold's stress as measure of windload, stem accelerations as measures of tree response, and magnitudes of mechanical transfer functions. The main result is that conifers such as spruce trees can be compared to a narrow bandpass filter, i.e. they can take in energy from the turbulent wind field only at a certain frequency range.},

	abstract = {Modelling the biomechanics of growing trees is a non-classical problem, as the usual framework of structural mechanics does not take into account the evolution of the domain geometry due to growth processes. Incremental approaches have been used in rod theory to bypass this problem and to model the addition of new material points on an existing deformed structure. However, these approaches are based on the explicit time numerical algorithm of an unknown continuous model, and thus, the accuracy of the numerical results obtained cannot be analysed. A new continuous space-time formulation has been recently proposed to model the biomechanical response of growing rods. The aim of this paper is to discretise the corresponding non-linear system of partial differential equations and the linearised system in order to compare the numerical results with analytical solutions of the linearised problem. The finite element method is implemented to compute the space boundary problem and different time integration schemes are considered to solve the associated initial value problem with a special attention to the forward Euler method which is the analogue of the previously used incremental approach. The numerical results point out that the accuracy of the time integration schemes strongly depends on the value of the parameters. The forward Euler method may present slow convergence property and errors with significant orders of magnitude. Nevertheless, attention must be paid to implicit methods since, for specific values of the parameters and large time steps, they may lead to spurious solutions that may come from numerical instabilities. Hence, the second order Heun’s method is an interesting alternative even if it is more time consuming.},

	abstract = {Context Microfibril angle ({MFA)} is one of the key determinants of solid timber performance due to its strong influence on the stiffness, strength, shrinkage properties and dimensional stability of wood. Aims The aim of this study was to develop a model for predicting {MFA} variation in plantation-grown Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L). A specific objective was to quantify the additional influence of growth rate on the radial variation in {MFA.} Methods Twenty-three trees were sampled from four mature Scots pine stands in Scotland, {UK.} Pith-to-bark {MFA} profiles were obtained on 69 radial samples using scanning X-ray diffractometry. A nonlinear mixed-effects model based on a modified {Michaelis–Menten} equation was developed using cambial age and annual ring width as explanatory variables. Results The largest source of variation in {MFA} ({\textbackslash}textgreater90 \%) was within trees, while between-tree variation represented just 7 \% of the total. Microfibril angle decreased rapidly near the pith before reaching stable values in later annual rings. The effect of ring width on {MFA} was greater at higher cambial ages. Conclusion A large proportion of the variation in {MFA} was explained by the fixed effects of cambial age and annual ring width. The final model is intended for integration into growth, yield and wood quality simulation systems.},

Moreover, the study examined the potential for genetic selection of radiata pine clones with high moe using current acoustic technology. The clone selection criteria were based on growth traits, basic density, and sound velocity indices to mirror the range in wood density and moe amongst c. 1000 clones. The selected 22 clones, represented by two trees each, were measured for moe, spiral grain, wood density, compression wood percentage, and mfa. Good agreement was found between static moe and dynamic moe. Both static and dynamic moe measurements were found to be primarily dependent on mfa (clonal range 28–39 degrees). Although wood density (clonal range 300–400 kg/m3) did not have a significant influence on moe alone, it was significant in combination with mfa. Compression wood tended to reduce moe and inflate wood density. The opportunities for genetic selection of radiata clones with high stiffness seem promising as the 22 selected clones exhibited a two-fold range of static moe (2.2–4.7 {GPa)} and the clonal heritabilities ( {TeXHˆ\{2\}\_\{i\}} ) for moe, density and mfa were high.},

	abstract = {The analysis of the shape evolution of growing trees requires an accurate modelling of the interaction between growth and biomechanics, including both static and adaptive responses. However, this coupling is a problematic issue since the progressive addition of a new material on an existing deformed body makes the definition of a reference configuration unclear. This article presents a new mathematical framework for rod theory that allows overcoming this difficulty in the case of slender structures that grow both in length and diameter like tree branches. A key point in surface growth problems is the strong dependency between space and time. On this basis, the virtual reference configuration was defined as the set of initial geometric properties of the cross-sections at their date of appearance. The classical balance equations of the rod theory were then reformulated with respect to this evolving reference configuration. This new continuous formulation leads to an evolution equation of the relaxed configuration that takes into account changes in material and geometrical properties of the growing rod. Primary (linked to growth in length) and secondary (linked to growth in diameter) tropisms, i.e. the adaptive biomechanical response of growing trees to the local environment, were also considered as a component of remodelling in tree growth, which modifies the relaxed configuration. Analytical solutions of our growth model was found in simple cases, i.e. assuming planar and small deflections and considering a linear elastic constitutive law. Corresponding motion results were compared with results provided by the classical rod theory and analysed with regards to growth strategies involved in gravitropic responses. These first qualitative results show that the proposed mathematical model was able to simulate the main processes involved in tree growth. This mathematical formalism is particularly suited to study the biomechanical response of trees subjected to quasi-static loads. This contribution also provides new insight into a more general three-dimensional theory of surface growth and raises new mathematical challenges about the analysis of this original system of partial differential equations.},

Numerical simulations were performed for both pine and spruce to investigate how different sawn pattern options affect the shape stability of individual boards. Results for spruce presented earlier have shown clearly that warping of the timber products is strongly influenced by the annual ring patterns within the individual boards. Comparisons between the two species were performed to study how the radial variations in the basic properties such as shrinkage parameters, stiffness parameters, and spiral grain have influence on the warping. Generally, the intrinsic patterns of variation in wood properties within stems were similar, and both species show a tendency to distort with changing moisture environment. There are strong indications that intelligent re-combination of material in glued products may overcome many of the inherent problems in using biological material with predictable variation in material properties.},

Several recent articles show that mechanical factors also contribute to the establishment and robustness of cell polarity, and the different molecular actors of cell polarity are now viewed as integrators of both biochemical and mechanical signals. Although cell polarity remains a complex process, some level of functional convergence between plants and animals is revealed.

	abstract = {The risk of wind damage was assessed for Sitka spruce growing in the Border Forest Park, Great Britain and radiata pine growing in the Central North Island, New Zealand using a quantitative wind risk model ({FORESTGALES).} The model has been adapted for the two species using estimates of maximum resistive bending moment from historical tree winching studies performed in the two regions, drag coefficients obtained from wind tunnel tests, and wind data from representative meteorological stations. The risk is calculated as the probability that the threshold wind speed for damage will be exceeded at a particular site. This approach enables the effect of different growth rates, soil types, management regimes and wind climates to be investigated. The threshold wind speed for tree failure was calculated for stands of both species grown under standard regimes on typical soils and characteristic topography. The probability that the threshold wind speed is exceeded was determined using a recurrence function fitted to time-series of annual maximum hourly wind speeds from a representative long-term meteorological station for each region. The two species are grown over substantially different rotation lengths, so comparisons were made between the profile of risk over a single rotation, and also as cumulative risk over a time-span sufficient to contain multiple rotations. The results demonstrate substantial differences in the probability of wind damage between forests in the two regions as they are currently managed. Contrary to expectation, the risk is lowest for forests in the region of the most severe wind climate, because of the selection of a risk-minimising strategy. This finding emphasises the degree to which management of forests can affect the frequency and amount of damage that they experience. The model was portable and provided objective estimates of risk for two very different locations and silvicultural regimes. Further development should provide a tool of practical importance for those seeking to make comparisons between very different situations, such as multi-national companies and re-insurers.},

The method and computational procedures were checked by comparing computed height–diameter profiles with those calculated using elementary stress theory for trees with simple force distributions in the crown. Measured height–diameter profiles for trees were then taken from the literature and shown to be well-fitted by profiles calculated to give uniform stress along the stems, using the most realistic average forces and force distributions within the crowns. At high wind speeds, the height–diameter profile giving uniform stress was more tapered than the profile giving uniform stress at low wind speeds. The profile giving uniform stress was similar over the normal range of average wind speeds of 2.5 to 10.0 m s−1 (at the top of the canopy). But a tree that had grown to give uniform stress along its stem in an average wind of 5 m s−1 showed markedly decreased stress with height at wind speeds of about 15 m s−1 or more, and increased stress with height (to the crown base) at wind speeds of about 1.25 m s−1 or less. The fact that tree stems develop shapes in response to average conditions, but show varying stress distribution in extreme conditions, may help to explain some of the apparent evidence for non-uniform stress distribution in the literature. In general, our analysis supports the above hypothesis for the stem region above the butt swell.},

Investigation of characteristic samples with respect to loading-unloading-reloading cycles for states of stress below failure reveals behavior similar to what is known as hardening type {plasticity.The} experimentally observed mechanical behavior is described by means of a two-surface plasticity model addressing both failure and non-linear stress response below failure as separate mechanisms. Prediction of failure is achieved by means of a second-order failure envelope according to Tsai and Wu. The non-linear stress response has to be covered by a novel orthotropic hardening type plasticity model.

The presentation of the material is particularly suited to the range of mathematicians, scientists, and engineers who want to exploit multiscale methods in applications. Extensive use of examples shows how to apply multiscale methods to solve a variety of problems. Exercises then enable readers to build their own skills and put them into practice.

The results reveal a distinctive Te-Co strength asymmetry with a moisture dependency that is visualized clearly by the Te to Co yield stress ratio. The Te-Co asymmetry is further shown by the inequality of the elastic properties, known as the “bimodular behavior”. The latter is proven for the Young’s moduli values in the radial and tangential directions and for individual Poisson’s ratios. Although the bimodularity of the Young’s moduli is significant at low {MC} levels, there is no evidence of moisture dependency on the Te-Co asymmetry of the Poisson’s ratios.},

Karst.), and birch (Betula spp.) is presented. The model predicts the critical turning moment and wind speed at which the trees will be uprooted or break at forest margins. The resistance to uprooting is predicted using the estimate of the root-soil plate weight to derive a resistive moment, while the resistance to stem breakage relies on values for the modulus of rupture determined for different species of timber. A tree is assumed to be uprooted if the total turning moment exceeds the support provided by the root-soil plate anchorage. Similarly, a tree is assumed to break if the breaking stress acting on the stem exceeds a critical value of the modulus of rupture. The model is in general quite sensitive to parameter changes, which partly results from the location in the forest to which it was designed to apply (the stand edge). The predictions..., Cet article présente un modèle mécaniste permettant d'évaluer le risque de dommages causés par le vent et la neige pour des arbres individuels et des peuplements de pin sylvestre (Pinus sylvestris L.), d'épinette de Norvège (Picea abies (L.)

The established hexagonal honeycomb model for prediction of E R is based on a cell wall bending mechanism only. If cell wall stretching also takes place, the dependence of E R on relative density will be different. If experimental data for E R as a function of relative density show deviations from cell wall bending predictions, this may indicate the presence of cell wall stretching. A {SilviScan} apparatus is used to measure density distribution. A procedure by means of digital speckle photography is then developed for measurements of local E R within the annual rings of spruce. Comparison is made between experimental data and the two expected density dependencies from cell wall bending and from stretching. The hypothesis of cell wall stretching as a contributing mechanism is supported based on the observed linear dependence of E R over a wide density range.},

The source of stress is the maturation strains in new wood cells, which give rise to growth stresses. The methods are generally applicable to the case of spiral grain with a grain angle varying with radius, which often is the case in trees. Also, the methods allow for the elastic constants to vary with the radius, which is important to model, for example, juvenile wood. The numerical solutions are checked against an analytical solution in the case of a constant grain angle, and are found to coincide. In addition, the two methods are shown to independently produce the same stress distribution for one pattern of grain angle variation. This shows that the methods are reliable, and they will be used for obtaining a wider range of solutions in a subsequent paper.},

The latter permits identification of active failure mechanisms and control over six distinct strength functions. These strength functions are used for the definition of a deformable elliptical state surface. Special issues concerning an effective numerical implementation of the proposed model are discussed. The return mapping algorithm is adopted for this purpose. It remains fully functional and effective for the orthotropic model with its non-conventional hardening/softening behavior. Moreover, the consistent tangent can be given as a closed form expression.

Distributions of these variables were compared with stiffness variations in the vertical direction. Results supported the hypothesis that cell ultrastructure is responsible for the vertical variation in stiffness. The microfibril orientation in tangential wall is considered to be an important factor contributing to wood stiffness because of the smaller microfibril angles compared with radial microfibril angles, and also because of the larger decrease of the microfibril angles with the rapid increase of wood stiffness in vertical direction especially in corewood zone. The microfibrils in the S3 layer fall from over 80° to angles of 54° and 51° for radial and tangential cell walls at the top of the butt log.

	abstract = {Models predicting forest stand wind-firmness are usually based on the calculation of a critical wind speed above which the mean tree of a stand is broken or uprooted. This approach is well adapted to regular stands, but in heterogeneous stands, not all the trees are necessarily damaged at the same time. Models used to analyse the distribution of damage within a population of trees can be a good alternative. In this perspective we developed {FOREOLE}, an individual-based mechanical model of tree response to wind. {FOREOLE} is based on a numerical description of tree structure allowing both wind and self-weight loads to be calculated at every level of the stem, as well as the bending moment at the tree base and mechanical stresses along the stem. We use a static approach to model wind forces in which the turbulent aspect of wind is taken into account through a gust factor. Stem breakage or uprooting is then predicted from comparisons to failure criteria, i.e. critical bending moment and critical compressive stress, respectively. Implemented in the software called {CAPSIS}, {FOREOLE} is compatible with a model of coniferous forest stand dynamics and allows wind-firmness to be simulated both in measured and virtual populations of trees. On individual trees, {FOREOLE} provided predictions of critical wind speed comparable to the existing models known as {GALES} and {HWIND}, despite differences in the method used to describe tree shape and to solve mechanics. These predictions appeared particularly sensitive to the gust factor and the drag coefficient. We then analysed the influence of stand structure, wind speed and individual tree characteristics on the type and amount of damage. From simulations in stands representing three different structures (regular, intermediate and selection stands), we showed that irregular stands experience scattered damage for a relatively wide range of wind speeds, whereas regular stands tend to collapse as a whole above a critical wind speed. Irregularity also increased the ratio between loss in volume of wood and loss in number of trees. Regarding tree characteristics, the highest and the slenderest subjects were the most sensitive, both to stem breakage and to overturning. Sensitivity to breakage was also increased by shorter crowns. In addition, statistical analysis of the simulation results also showed that wind speed remained the most significant variable in explaining wind damage.},

	abstract = {The aim of this study was to investigate bending stiffness and compression strength perpendicular to the grain of Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) trunkwood with different anatomical and hydraulic properties. Hydraulically less safe mature sapwood had bigger hydraulic lumen diameters and higher specific hydraulic conductivities than hydraulically safer juvenile wood. Bending stiffness ({MOE)} was higher, whereas radial compression strength lower in mature than in juvenile wood. A density-based tradeoff between {MOE} and hydraulic efficiency was apparent in mature wood only. Across cambial age, bending stiffness did not compromise hydraulic efficiency due to variation in latewood percent and because of the structural demands of the tree top (e.g. high flexibility). Radial compression strength compromised, however, hydraulic efficiency because it was extremely dependent on the characteristics of the “weakest” wood part, the highly conductive earlywood. An increase in conduit wall reinforcement of earlywood tracheids would be too costly for the tree. Increasing radial compression strength by modification of microfibril angles or ray cell number could result in a decrease of {MOE}, which would negatively affect the trunk’s capability to support the crown. We propose that radial compression strength could be an easily assessable and highly predictive parameter for the resistance against implosion or vulnerability to cavitation across conifer species, which should be topic of further studies.},

For these trees wood properties were measured on radial slices sampled at a height of 1.4 m above the ground. Relative to wide spacing, close initial stand spacing significantly reduced microfibril angle ({MFA)} and ring width and significantly increased dynamic modulus of elasticity ({MOE)}, fibre length, latewood percentage and cell wall thickness. Density and fibre width were not significantly different between spacing treatments. Examination of the influence of genetic population on wood properties indicated that genotype significantly influenced {MFA}, {MOE} and ring width. The key wood properties {MFA}, {MOE} and fibre length were regressed against tree diameter, height and stem slenderness. All three wood properties were most strongly correlated with stem slenderness. Multiple regression models developed for {MFA}, {MOE} and ring width accounted for respectively 62\%, 81\% and 58\% of the variation in these variables. The following changes occurred in sampled properties with increasing ring number: {MFA} and ring width declined markedly; {MOE} and fibre length increased markedly; latewood percentage and cell wall thickness increased slightly; and density and fibre width did not show any radial trend.},

The resulting incremental displacements allowed the tree shape to be modified. The field of growth stresses was calculated within the stem, using a cumulative process taking into consideration the past history of each growth ring. The simulation results of trunk and branch shape, as well as internal stresses, were examined after consideration of different growth strategies. A block of trees was also simulated in order to show the influence of spatial competition on stem curvature and the variability in growth stress.},

The method is based on tensile tests under microscope that are performed with the assistance of an image analysis system. The calculation of the strain field is based on a global comparison of the grey levels between each deformed image and the initial image. All tests were carried out within one annual ring of spruce: • radial and tangential Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio can be measured in earlywood with a good accuracy, • radial Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio of tracheids in latewood can be estimated with good confidence, • two tests of very thin samples allowed the evaluation of the tangential elastic modulus in latewood. The small size of the sample together with the local measurement of the strain field permitted us to perform several measurements along one single annual ring. Consequently, it was possible to reveal a good relationship between the mechanical properties and the local density determined by microdensitometry.},

In addition, crown size, proportion of compression wood and mechanical properties of wood were investigated on 12 sets of trees of similar diameter that had snapped, overturned or remained undamaged from each of two further wind-damaged stands of Sitka spruce. No difference in stem diameter, height or slenderness ratio were found between the damaged and undamaged trees sampled from the dry part of the wind-damaged stand. On the wet part of the site, however, the snapped trees were found to be significantly taller and of greater diameter than the undamaged or overturned trees although slenderness ratios were similar for all trees. The experiment investigating matched sets of trees found that the snapped and overturned trees had significantly smaller crowns than the undamaged trees. Furthermore, the snapped trees had wood in the outer part of the stem that was less stiff, but of bending strength similar to that of similar wood taken from the undamaged and overturned trees. According to the results, high proportions of compression wood may be involved in the occurrence of storm damage. It is suggested that trees containing compression wood should be preferentially removed from the forest during thinning. Since it is not feasible to measure compression wood in standing trees, the presence of leaning stems or asymmetric crowns should be used to identify the trees to be removed. Furthermore, trees with small crowns should also be preferentially removed during thinning.},

In the present study the mechanical properties of the cellular structure of wood are characterized and modelled, the irregular cell shape, the anisotropic layered structure of the cell walls and the periodic variations in density being taken into account. The continuum properties were derived by use of a homogenization procedure and the finite element method. Stiffness and shrinkage properties determined by this procedure are presented and are compared with measured data. The constitutive properties thus determined at various structural levels can be used in numerical simulations of the behaviour of wood in different industrially related areas. One such area is that of the refining process in mechanical pulp manufacture. Simulations of the deformation and fracturing of wood specimens loaded under conditions similar to those found in the refining process are presented.

	shorttitle = {Age- and position-related changes in hydraulic versus mechanical dysfunction of xylem},
	abstract = {We do not know why trees exhibit changes in wood characteristics as a function of cambial age. In part, the answer may lie in the existence of a tradeoff between hydraulic properties and mechanical support. In conifers, longitudinal tracheids represent 92\% of the cells comprising the wood and are involved in both water transport and mechanical support. We used three hydraulic parameters to estimate hydraulic safety factors at several vertical and radial locations in the trunk and branches: vulnerability to cavitation; variation in xylem water potential (psi); and xylem relative water content. The hydraulic safety factors for 12 and 88 percent loss of conductivity (S(H12) and S(H88), representing the hydraulic safety factors for the air entry point and full embolism point, respectively) were determined. We also estimated the mechanical safety factor for maximum tree height and for buckling. We estimated the dimensionless hydraulic and mechanical safety factors for six seedlings (4 years old), six saplings (10 years old) and six mature trees ({\textbackslash}textbackslashtextgreater 110 years old) of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco). Over the natural range of psi, S(H12) decreased linearly from treetop to a minimum of 0.95 at the tree base. Young and mature trees had S(H12) values 1.4 and 1.3 times higher, respectively, at their tips (juvenile wood) than at their bases (mature wood). Modeling analyses indicated that if trees were made entirely of mature wood, S(H12) at the stem base would be only 0.7. The mechanical safety factor was 1.2 times higher for the base of the tree than for the rest of the tree. The minimum mechanical safety factor-1.6 for the critical buckling height and 2.2 for the critical buckling load-occurred at the base of the live crown. Modeling analysis indicated that if trees were made only of mature wood, these values would increase to 1.7 and 2.3, respectively. Hydraulic safety factors had values that were less than half those for mechanical safety factors, suggesting that wood structure in Douglas-fir has evolved primarily as a result of selection for hydraulic safety rather than mechanical safety. The results suggest that forest managers must consider the role of juvenile wood in tree physiology to avoid producing plantations vulnerable to drought.},

New cells are formed at the periphery of the existing body, the properties of the older inner material being unchanged. The calculation of the progressive deflection of a growing stem is not a classical problem in mechanics for three main reasons: 1‐ the hypothesis of mass conservation is not valid; 2‐ the new material added at the periphery of the existing and deformed structure does not participate retroactively to the total equilibrium and tends to “fix” the actual shape; 3‐ an initial reference configuration corresponding to the unloaded structure cannot be classically defined to formulate the equilibrium equations. This paper proposes a theoretical framework that allows bypassing these difficulties. Equations adapted from the beam theory and considering the strong dependencies between space and time are given. A numerical scheme based on the finite element method is proposed to solve these equations. The model opens new research perspectives both in mathematics and plant biology.},

The system consists of a small compression device, a stereo-microscope, a video microscaler, a videocassette recorder and a computer-based data logger. The significance of this system is that it allows the influence of cellular structure of wood on its stress-strain behavior and the cell-wall collapse mechanism to be studied. This test system was used in a research program aimed at generating some basic understanding of microstructural behavior of wood under transverse compression. Tests were conducted on white spruce specimens to evaluate the proposed test procedure and system, and the influences of some microscopic and macroscopic features such as wood density, cell-wall thickness, and earlywood/latewood ratio. End-matched specimens were tested using the test system at three levels of magnification. Gross and individual ring behaviors were observed and measured by testing at a low magnification ({12X).} Earlywood and latewood behaviors were measured separately using a medium level of magnification ({32X).} Finally the mechanism of cell-wall collapse was observed using the highest magnification ({160X).} Test results show that earlywood and latewood have varying degrees of influence on the various segments of the gross stress-strain curve in radial compression. First collapse of cellular structure occurs at a location with minimum cell-wall thickness and density. Initiation of cell-wall collapse and its gradual progression are clearly visible using the apparatus, thereby verifying the capability of the proposed method.},

	abstract = {Wood exhibits a hierarchical architecture. Its macroscopic properties are determined by microstructural features at different scales of observation. Recent developments of experimental micro-characterisation techniques have delivered further insight into the appearance and the behaviour of wood at smaller length scales. The improved knowledge and the availability of increasingly powerful micromechanical modelling techniques and homogenisation methods have stimulated rather comprehensive research on multiscale modelling of wood. Linking microstructural properties to macroscopic characteristics is expected to improve the knowledge of the mechanical behaviour of wood and to serve as the basis for the development of innovative wood-based products and for biomimetic material design. Moreover, understanding fundamental aspects of wood machining requires multiscale approaches which can take into account the heterogeneity, anisotropy and hierarchies of wood and wood composites. In this review, recent developments in the field of hierarchical modelling of the hygroelastic behaviour of wood are discussed, and a short outline of the theoretical background is given. Much focus is placed on composite micromechanical models for the wood cell wall and on multiscale models for wood resting upon hierarchical finite element models and on the application of continuum micromechanics, respectively. These models generally lead to the specification of equivalent homogeneous continua with effective material properties. Finally, current deficiencies and limitations of hierarchical models are sketched and possible future research directions are specified.},

	abstract = {We calculated the wind-induced bending moments and stresses generated in the stems of five Prunus serotina conspecifics differing in height and canopy shape and size (based on detailed measurements of stem projected area and location with respect to ground level) to test the hypothesis that wind-loads generate uniform and constant stress levels along the lengths of tree twigs, branches, and trunks. These calculations were performed using five different wind speed profiles to evaluate the relative importance of the shape of wind speed profiles versus the ’geometry’ of tree shape on stem stress distributions and magnitudes. Additionally, we evaluated the effect of absolute tree size and stem taper on wind- induced stresses by scaling the size of smaller conspecifics to the absolute height of the largest of the five trees yet retaining the original stem proportions (i.e., diameter relative to stem length) for each plant. Finally, we also determined how the factor of safety for wind-loading (i.e., the quotient of stem yield stress and wind-load stress) changed as a function of tree size (and, presumably, age). Our results indicate that wind-load stress levels (1) vary along stem length even for the same wind speed profile and the same maximum wind speed; (2) would increase to dangerous levels with increasing tree height if it were not for ontogenetic changes in stem taper and canopy shape that reduce stress intensities to manageable levels; (3) tend to be more dependent on stem taper and canopy shape and size than on the shape of the wind speed profile; and (4) the factor of safety against wind-induced mechanical failure decreases as trees get larger, but varies along the length of large trees such that preferential stem failure is likely and functionally adaptive. We thus (1) reject the hypothesis of constant wind-induced stress levels; (2) support the view that size-dependent changes in stem taper are required to maintain wind-load mechanical reliability; and (3) suggest that certain portions of mature trees are ’designed’ to fail under high winds speeds, thereby reducing drag and the bending moments and stresses experienced by trunks.},

The mathematical description of both the equations of state and the evolution laws are formulated on a thermodynamical basis. A semianalytical solution algorithm is derived for the obtained nonlinear system of differential equations. The model is applicable over a wide range of temperature as well as moisture content ({20–120°C;} nearly 0\% moisture content to fiber saturation), which is achieved through application of the time-temperature-moisture superposition principle and the introduction of a moisture-change-temperature superposition principle. A set of material parameters suitable for this range of conditions is given for Pinus silvestris.},

In a combination of tensile tests with structural investigations by small angle X- ray scattering on the same sample of Picea abies, we found a remarkable increase in maximum strain with increasing {MFA}, and also a change in the elastic moduli.},

In addition, wood hardening behaviour in the plastic region and differences between stress increase and decrease have been taken into account. The proposed Stress model can predict stress development and relief in a drying cycle once the required wood mechanical and Theological properties have been quantified. Drying experiments were performed to dry Pinus radiata sap wood boards of 100×40×590 mm in a tunnel dryer. In the experiment, wood temperature, moisture content gradient and residual stress through board thickness were measured. The drying cycle included {HT} drying, cooling and final steam conditioning. The measured stress patterns were in agreement with the model predictions. However, more accurate calculations will be made once the detailed experimental data for radiata pine wood mechanical and rheological properties are available.},

	abstract = {It is not fully understood how much growth stresses affect the final quality of solid timber products in terms of, e.g. shape stability. It is, for example, difficult to predict the internal growth stress field within the tree stem. Growth stresses are progressively generated during the tree growth and they are highly influenced by climate, biologic and material-related factors. To increase the knowledge of the stress formation, a finite element model was created to study how the growth stresses develop during the tree growth. The model is an axisymmetric general plane strain model where material for all new annual rings is progressively added to the tree during the analysis. The material model used is based on the theory of small strains (where strains refer to the undeformed configuration which is good approximation for strains less than 4\%) where so-called biological maturation strains (growth-related strains that form in the wood fibres during their maturation) are used as a driver for the stress generation. It is formulated as an incremental material model that takes into account elastic strain, maturation strain, viscoelastic strain and progressive stiffening of the wood material. The results clearly show how the growth stresses are progressively generated during the tree growth. The inner core becomes more and more compressed, whereas the outer sapwood is subjected to slightly increased tension. The parametric study shows that the growth stresses are highly influenced by the creep behaviour and evolution of parameters such as modulus of elasticity, micro-fibril angle and maturation strain.},

Some of the more intriguing aspects of the secondary vascular system include the recent discovery of a putative plant muscle and identification of a cytoskeleton-facilitated three-dimensional symplasmic transport pathway that permeates the tree. There are great merits in the recently adopted model tree species, poplar, and a new model system - wood formation in Arabidopsis. The time is now right for much greater exploitation of the possibilities that exist for study of the secondary vascular system of trees.},
